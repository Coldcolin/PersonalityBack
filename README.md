## Example

```javascript
// Sample trait scores
traits = {
  openness: 85,
  cognitive_flexibility: 90,
  information_processing: 80,
  past_learning: 75,
  learning_commitment: 85
}

// Learning Potential calculation
learningPotential = (
  85 * 0.2 +  // openness
  90 * 0.2 +  // cognitive_flexibility
  80 * 0.2 +  // information_processing
  75 * 0.2 +  // past_learning
  85 * 0.2    // learning_commitment
) = 83
```
